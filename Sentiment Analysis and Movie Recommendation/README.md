# Sentiment Analysis and Recommender System Project

## Introduction

This project is a personal endeavor aimed at deepening my understanding of Sentiment Analysis and Recommender Systems. Through this project, I aim to explore and apply various machine learning algorithms and data preprocessing techniques to gain insights into consumer sentiments and recommend products or services based on user preferences.

The motivation behind this project stems from my interest in harnessing the power of machine learning to analyze vast amounts of data and extract meaningful information that can assist in decision-making processes. Sentiment Analysis and Recommender Systems are pivotal in understanding user feedback and enhancing user experience, respectively, making them fascinating areas for application and study.

## Datasets Used

The project utilizes a collection of datasets that encompass reviews and metadata from diverse domains. These datasets are instrumental in training the machine learning models to perform Sentiment Analysis and generate recommendations. The datasets used include:

- `All_Beauty_5.json`: Contains user reviews for beauty products listed on Amazon.
- `AMAZON_FASHION_5.json`: Comprises user reviews for fashion products available on Amazon.
- `IMDB_top_1000.csv`: Features data on the top 1000 movies listed on IMDB, including reviews and ratings.
- `meta_All_Beauty.json`: Metadata for the beauty products included in the `All_Beauty_5.json` dataset.
- `meta_AMAZON_FASHION.json`: Metadata for the fashion products included in the `AMAZON_FASHION_5.json` dataset.

These datasets provide a comprehensive overview of user sentiments across different categories, allowing for the analysis and modeling of user preferences and sentiment trends.

## Project Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are as follows:

1. **Learn and Apply Sentiment Analysis:** To understand the underlying principles of Sentiment Analysis and apply these techniques to analyze user reviews and sentiments expressed within the datasets.
2. **Develop a Recommender System:** To build a Recommender System that can suggest products or services to users based on their preferences and the sentiment analysis of user reviews.
3. **Master Data Preprocessing:** To explore various data preprocessing techniques essential for cleaning and preparing data for analysis and modeling. This includes handling missing values, text preprocessing, and feature extraction.

## Tools and Technologies

This project leverages various tools and technologies, including but not limited to:

- Python: For data preprocessing, analysis, and model development.
- Pandas & NumPy: For data manipulation and numerical computations.
- Scikit-learn: For machine learning model development.
- NLTK & SpaCy: For natural language processing tasks.
